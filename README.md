# SOABB1
This online repository contains the data processing and analysis scripts underlying the article entitled ‘Infants recognise their own voice well before recognising their own face’, as well as the anonymised tabulated data associated with this work. 

## Repository structure

### Codes

* _analyses_MT_gaze.ipynb_ : runs the looking time analyses during the mirror task, to compare looking time to the mirror before and after the red mark is placed on the infant forehead.
* _Script1_cutFiles.ipynb_ : processes audio recordings by separating infant vocalisations from other sounds and merging vocalisations that are the same type and produced by the same child in the same phase which are less than 500ms apart. The results are stored in the .csv file with this name structure: "NX_sounds_details".
* _Script2_extractPitch.ipynb_ : extracts the fundamental frequency (f0), harmonic-to-noise (HNR) and root mean square (RMS) of the vocalisations in each phase of the experiment (experimental and baseline) with Praat, based on the .csv file generated by _Script1_cutFiles.ipynb_. To run this script, download _Pitch_BB.praat_ and _utilities_SOA.py_ (both included in this repository). Make sure to update your local path to _Pitch_BB.praat_ inside _utilities_SOA.py_. It generates a .csv file with the following name structure: f0_HNR_RMS_NX.csv
* _Script3_plotResults.ipynb_ : preprocesses data, plots results and runs descriptive statistics based on the results file with the following format: f0_HNR_RMS_NX.csv

### Datasets

* _Références_audios_bb.xlsx_ contains the demographic details about the participants (e.g., age, languages spopken, sex, date of birth) as well as details and notes concerning the test (e.g., date, timing of f0 modification relative to the onset of the recording, etc). This file is used in Script 1.
* _N_sounds_details.csv_ is generated at the end of Script 1 and contains the start and end times of parent and child vocalisations and the vocalisation type, the phase in which it was produced (BL: baseline - before f0 modification or EXP: experimental - after f0 modification). It does not yet include the f0, which is extracted in Script 2 starting from this file. 
* _N_f0_HNR_RMS.csv_ is the final dataset generated at the end of Script 2, containing the duration, start and end times of each vocalisation, the phase in which it was produced (baseline or experimental), the vocalisation type, and who produced it (i.e., baby or mum). It also includes the average f0 for each vocalisation, along with demographic details for each participant, including age, linguistic background, vocabulary size at 18 months, and other relevant information. Script 3 runs on this file.
* _MT_comp.csv_ (in Python > videos) containing looking time data during the mirror task
* _BT_comp.csv_ (in Python > videos) containing looking time data during the interaction
